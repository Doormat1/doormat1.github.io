This is a collection of webpages I am creating for my teaching. So far there are two that should work
- Heating water - this is a simulation of heating ice to steam, recording the temperature as you go so you graph the changes. 
- Circuit bingo - a simple game of bingo which generates random cards for on screen play but also calls the plays.
- Quiz Builder - built on a spreadsheet shared with along time ago via the IOP Cymru with questions for GCSE Physics. 
- Youngs Modulus On Screen Experiment - A simple web app to simulate the WJEC Specified Practical on Young's Modulus
